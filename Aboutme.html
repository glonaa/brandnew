    <br>
    My name is Gloria and I hope you have enjoyed the website so far. 
    <br>
    I have previously worked within the commidities for industrial and commerical business.
    <br>
    This was a brilliant oppertunity for me in order to change my career path and take the first step into Tech world.
    <br>
    Thanks to Codenation I have managed to learn three coding program languages; Python, CSS and HTML, which has worked to my benefit to create this beautiful website.
    <br>
    I am constantly looking to increase my coding languages skill, I am currently looking into PHP and SQL also. 
    <br>
    I really enjoyed this 3 weeks course and I am lookingforward to taking the master course to improve my atributes.
    <br>
    I hope you guys can connect with me on Linkedin.
