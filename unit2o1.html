    For creating the home page, I used padding and a large font, I decided to stick to less as it is more to give the welcome page a clear cosy look, therefore the main attention is on the navigation bar. 
    <br>
    I chose a subtle background to provide a contemporary look and bring assignment type of feeling to the website. 
    I really love marble therefore I ensure this was my main page and as I am creating this website from home, hence the background being my marble desk. 
    <br> 
    I ensure all the units are in one drop down on the navigation bar to prevent overcrowding on the nav bar.
    For the units I stuck to the same layout for each by using big heading and padding with a border to make it stand out.
    
    I then chose a similar picture for the units’ background, which is a over top view of a desk, because that’s where I spent most of my time creating this website and to give it a professional minimalism look. 
    <br>
    For the contact me page I created contact form where I can be reached via. 
    Details are also provided on the contact me page for further information. 
    <br>
    On the about me page I decided to add introduction video along side some more information and a link to my Linkedin page for further networking.

    Copyright and other protected innovation laws influence sites since it might limit what you can distribute.
    The most ideal approach to get around this is first, get authorization from the first creator, second, on the off chance that you need to distribute data on your site from another site, connect to it and maybe get consent to distribute a portion from the first website.</p>
