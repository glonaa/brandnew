    The product utilized for making this site was Github, Trello, and visual studio code. The utilization of this product to make a site was helpful as it's important to make your site utilizing Visual Studio Code and Github. 
<br>
<br>
    Trello is basically utilized for an association to give you a visual perspective on the venture you might want to land effectively. 
<br>   
    During the way toward making the site, I rolled out specific improvements utilizing visual studio code to the site in regards to the drop-down on the landing page anyway the drop-down wasn't as powerful so I at that point needed to utilize HTML and CSS inside visual studio code to roll out the improvements important.

    I will be using the same tools used in this project such as Trello, visual studio code and Githup.

    Once creating content, I frequently saved my work each time whether that was in HTML or CSS and checked the website to see if everything I have changed has edited to my expectations.
    The HTML content would be to check whether the formatting is correct in terms of what will be displayed as a heading, paragraphs, the individual hyper references to other HTML files are called into the backbone of a nav bar. 
    As well as dividing the page into sections of which to call for in CSS by using Divs. I have also separated different parts of my written content into classes and ID's - these are to be called in CSS so I can edit segments of each page to my liking. 
    Once everything is saved, I will refresh my web page to see if everything has been edited to fit the visual expectations are met - I will also follow these same steps with the visual representations of CSS.</p>
