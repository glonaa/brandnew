<p class="unit1o2">
   
    The product utilized for making this site was Github, Trello, and visual studio code. The utilization of this product to make a site was helpful as it's important to make your site utilizing Visual Studio Code and Github. 
<br>
<br>
    Trello is basically utilized for an association to give you a visual perspective on the venture you might want to land effectively. 
<br>   
    During the way toward making the site, I rolled out specific improvements utilizing visual studio code to the site in regards to the drop-down on the landing page anyway the drop-down wasn't as powerful so I at that point needed to utilize HTML and CSS inside visual studio code to roll out the improvements important.
    </p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
    <li><b><i> Describe whether the IT tools selected were 
        appropriate        
    </i></b>

<p class="unit1o2">
    subsequent to investigating for making this site the correct apparatuses and procedures were utilized. The product that was utilized was the Visual Studio Code utilizing the language of HTML and CSS. 
<br>
    What's more, to coordinate the assignments that should have been done, Trello was utilized because of its visual purposes.

        would you change? 
        </b>
</i>
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="unit1o2">
    I am really happy with the outcome of this website, if I could make a change and had more time within the contact page, I would add a chat box so they can gain access to online chat.

I think the website came out great being it my first time and having to design it in a specific way that it is not just written work like a blog.

        The website is created by visual studio code using CSS and HTML. 
        Using the tools necessary the website features such as the Navigation bar the Trello button, the paddings and scroll bar and backgrounds have all been created within CSS and HTM.
